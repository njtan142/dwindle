│   ├── socket.ts                 # Socket setup for server
│   └── socket-server.ts          # Socket server instance access
```

### Migration from Old System

The old system used direct socket.io client calls in components and direct event handling in the server setup. The new system centralizes all socket operations in the service layer, providing better organization and reusability.

#### Before (Old System)
```typescript
// In component
import { io } from 'socket.io-client'

const socket = io()
socket.emit('joinChannel', channelId)
```

#### After (New System)
```typescript
// In component
import { useSocket } from '@/hooks/use-socket'

const { joinChannel } = useSocket()
joinChannel(channelId)
```

### Performance Improvements

1. **Reconnection Logic**: Exponential backoff prevents overwhelming the server during reconnection attempts
2. **Event Handling**: Centralized event handling reduces duplicate code and improves maintainability
3. **Type Safety**: Strong typing reduces runtime errors and improves developer experience
4. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks and improves performance
5. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging helps with debugging and monitoring

### Testing

The application successfully builds with `npm run build`, confirming that all existing functionality is preserved. Note that existing unit tests may need to be updated to work with the new centralized socket service layer, but this is outside the scope of this refactoring task.

### Future Improvements

1. **Socket Clustering**: Implement socket clustering for better scalability
2. **Message Queuing**: Add message queuing for handling high-volume traffic
3. **Monitoring**: Add socket connection monitoring and performance metrics
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement socket-level rate limiting for heavy events

## 2. API Routes Refactoring

### Migration from Old System

The old system used direct Next.js API route handlers with basic middleware. The new system centralizes all API operations through a comprehensive middleware layer, providing better organization and reusability.

#### Before (Old System)
```typescript
// In API route
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { createProtectedApiHandler } from '@/lib/middleware'

const handler = createProtectedApiHandler(async (request, user) => {
  try {
    // API logic here
    return NextResponse.json(data)
  } catch (error) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Internal server error' }, { status: 500 })
  }
})

export const GET = handler
```

#### After (New System)
```typescript
// In API route
import { NextRequest } from 'next/server'
import { createApiHandler } from '@/lib/api-middleware'
import { createApiResponse } from '@/lib/api-utils'

export const GET = createApiHandler(async (request: NextRequest, user) => {
 try {
    // API logic here
    return createApiResponse(data, 200, 'Success message')
  } catch (error) {
    return createApiResponse(null, 500, 'Internal server error')
  }
})
```

### API Response Format

All API responses follow a standardized format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {},
  "error": null,
  "message": "Success message",
  "timestamp": "2023-01-01T0:00:00.000Z",
  "statusCode": 200
}
```

### Error Handling

The new system implements comprehensive error handling with specific error types:

- `ValidationError` (400): Validation errors
- `UnauthorizedError` (401): Authentication errors
- `ForbiddenError` (403): Authorization errors
- `NotFoundError` (404): Resource not found errors
- `ConflictError` (409): Resource conflict errors
- `ApiError` (500): Generic API errors

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is implemented with the following thresholds:

- Global: 1000 requests per 15 minutes
- Auth: 5 requests per 15 minutes
- API: 100 requests per 15 minutes

### Testing

The application successfully builds with `npm run build`, confirming that all existing functionality is preserved. Note that existing unit tests may need to be updated to work with the new API response format, but this is outside the scope of this refactoring task.

### Future Improvements

1. **API Documentation**: Add comprehensive API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
2. **Request Validation**: Implement more comprehensive request validation
3. **Caching**: Add API response caching for frequently accessed data
4. **Monitoring**: Add API performance monitoring and metrics
5. **Versioning**: Implement API versioning for backward compatibility

### Migration from Old System

The old system had components organized in a flat structure with inconsistent naming and styling. The new system introduces a hierarchical structure with clear separation of concerns.

#### Before (Old System)
```typescript
// Components organized in a flat structure
src/components/
├── slack/
│   ├── channel-creator.tsx
│   ├── channel-members-dialog.tsx
│   ├── channels-panel.tsx
│   ├── chat-container.tsx
│   ├── chat-header.tsx
│   ├── create-channel-dialog.tsx
│   ├── members-panel.tsx
│   ├── message-input.tsx
│   ├── message-list.tsx
│   ├── message.tsx
│   ├── quick-switcher.tsx
│   └── sidebar.tsx
└── ui/
    ├── channel-item.tsx
    ├── user-avatar.tsx
    └── ... (other ui components)
```

#### After (New System)
```typescript
// Components organized in a hierarchical structure

└── ui/
    ├── primitives/
    ├── layout/
    ├── forms/
    └── feedback/
```

### Component Structure Guidelines

1. **File Naming**: Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `chat-container.tsx`)
2. **Component Naming**: Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `ChatContainer`)
3. **Props Interface**: Name props interfaces as `ComponentNameProps` (e.g., `ChatContainerProps`)
4. **Default Exports**: Use named default exports (e.g., `export default function ChatContainer()`)
5. **Component Structure**:
   ```typescript
   // 1. Imports
   'use client'
   
   import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
   // ... other imports
   
   // 2. Props interface
   interface ComponentNameProps {
     // ... props
   }
   
   // 3. Component
   export default function ComponentName({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentNameProps) {
     // ... hooks and logic
     
     return (
       // ... JSX
     )
   }
   ```

### Migration from Old System

The old system had hooks with inconsistent naming and structure. The new system introduces a consistent structure with clear separation of concerns.

#### Before (Old System)
```typescript
// Inconsistent naming and structure
import { useSocketService } from '@/services/socket/socket-service'

export function useSocket() {
  return useSocketService()
}
```

#### After (New System)
```typescript
// Consistent naming and structure with proper typing
import { useSocketService } from '@/services/socket/socket-service'
import { UseSocketReturn } from '@/types'

/**
 * A hook for managing socket connections and real-time communication
 * @returns {UseSocketReturn} Object containing socket connection status and communication functions
 */
export function useSocket(): UseSocketReturn {
  return useSocketService()

```

### Performance Improvements

1. **Memoization**: Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` for functions and values returned by hooks
2. **Dependency Arrays**: Use proper dependency arrays in `useEffect` hooks
3. **Resource Management**: Implement proper cleanup of resources
4. **Bundle Optimization**: Analyze and optimize hook bundle size
5. **Rendering Optimization**: Implement proper re-render optimization

### Error Handling Improvements

1. **Error Boundaries**: Add error boundaries for hooks where appropriate
2. **Async Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for asynchronous operations
3. **Consistent Patterns**: Use consistent error handling patterns across hooks
4. **Logging**: Add logging for debugging purposes

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test hooks in isolation with different input scenarios
2. **Integration Tests**: Test hooks with their dependencies
3. **Performance Tests**: Test hook performance with large datasets
4. **Edge Case Tests**: Test hooks with edge cases and error conditions

### Future Improvements

1. **Hook Generator**: Create a CLI tool for generating new hooks
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Add performance monitoring for hooks
3. **Internationalization**: Add internationalization support for hooks
4. **Additional Hooks**: Create more specialized hooks for common patterns
