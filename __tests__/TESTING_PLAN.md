# Testing Plan for Add Users to Private Channels Feature

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the "Add Users to Private Channels" feature. The tests are organized into three categories:
1. Unit tests for API endpoints
2. Integration tests for UI components
3. End-to-end tests for complete user flows

## Test Organization
```
__tests__/
├── api/                 # Unit tests for API endpoints
├── ui/                  # Integration tests for UI components
└── e2e/                # End-to-end tests
```

## 1. Unit Tests for API Endpoints

### File: `__tests__/api/channel-members.test.js`

#### GET /api/channels/[id]/members
- Test case: Channel not found (404)
- Test case: Unauthorized access to private channel members (403)
- Test case: Successful retrieval of members for public channel
- Test case: Successful retrieval of members for private channel with authorization

#### POST /api/channels/[id]/members
- Test case: Request validation failure (400)
- Test case: Channel not found (404)
- Test case: Attempt to add members to public channel (400)
- Test case: Unauthorized access (403)
- Test case: User to add not found (404)
- Test case: User already a member (400)
- Test case: Successful addition of member to private channel

#### DELETE /api/channels/[id]/members/[userId]
- Test case: Request validation failure (400)
- Test case: Channel not found (404)
- Test case: Attempt to remove members from public channel (400)
- Test case: Unauthorized access (403)
- Test case: User to remove not a member (400)
- Test case: Attempt to remove last member (400)
- Test case: Successful removal of member from private channel

## 2. Integration Tests for UI Components

### File: `__tests__/ui/channel-members-dialog.test.js`

#### ChannelMembersDialog Component
- Test case: Render dialog trigger button
- Test case: Fetch and display channel members when dialog opens
- Test case: Show error message when fetching members fails
- Test case: Add a member to the channel successfully
- Test case: Show error when adding member fails
- Test case: Remove a member from the channel successfully
- Test case: Do not show remove button for current user

## 3. End-to-End Tests

### File: `__tests__/e2e/channel-members.e2e.test.js`

#### Complete Flow Tests
- Test case: Complete flow of adding a user to a private channel
- Test case: Verify added user can access the private channel
- Test case: Verify users not added to private channel cannot access it
- Test case: Real-time updates for member changes via socket events

## Test Execution

### Unit and Integration Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### End-to-End Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

## Test Coverage Goals

### API Endpoints
- [x] 100% coverage for success and error cases
- [x] All validation paths tested
- [x] All authorization scenarios tested
- [x] Edge cases covered (adding existing members, removing non-members, etc.)

### UI Components
- [x] Component rendering and user interactions
- [x] API integration points
- [x] Error handling and user feedback
- [x] State management

### End-to-End Flows
- [x] Complete user workflows
- [x] Real-time updates
- [x] Cross-component interactions
- [x] Data consistency between frontend and backend

## Mocking Strategy

### Database
- Mock Prisma client methods
- Simulate various database states (existing records, missing records, etc.)

### Network
- Mock fetch API calls
- Simulate successful and failed API responses

### Sockets
- Mock socket.io server
- Test event emission and handling

### UI Components
- Use @testing-library/react for component testing
- Mock child components to isolate tests

## Continuous Integration
These tests should be run as part of the CI pipeline to ensure:
1. New changes don't break existing functionality
2. All API endpoints work as expected
3. UI components render correctly
4. End-to-end user flows are functional
