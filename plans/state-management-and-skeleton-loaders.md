## üîç Analysis & Investigation

### Codebase Structure
After analyzing the codebase, I identified the following key files and components related to data fetching and API requests:
1. `src/app/page.tsx` - Main application component that fetches users and channels
2. `src/components/slack/chat-container.tsx` - Main chat component that fetches messages
3. `src/components/slack/channels-panel.tsx` - Displays channels list
4. `src/components/slack/members-panel.tsx` - Displays members list
5. `src/components/slack/message-list.tsx` - Displays messages
6. `src/components/slack/channel-creator.tsx` - Creates channels
7. `src/components/slack/channel-members-dialog.tsx` - Manages channel members
8. `src/components/slack/create-channel-dialog.tsx` - Creates channels via dialog
9. `src/components/ui/skeleton.tsx` - Existing skeleton component
10. `src/components/ui/loading-spinner.tsx` - Existing loading spinner component

### Current Architecture
The application uses React with Next.js App Router. Data fetching is currently done using `fetch()` calls within `useEffect` hooks and event handlers. Loading states are handled with simple boolean flags (`isLoading`) in some components. Components like `ChannelCreator` and `ChannelMembersDialog` already implement basic loading states with visual feedback.

### Dependencies & Integration Points
The application already has shadcn/ui components available, including:
1. `Skeleton` component (`src/components/ui/skeleton.tsx`) - Ready to use for skeleton loading
2. `LoadingSpinner` component (`src/components/ui/loading-spinner.tsx`) - Already used in some components

These components can be directly integrated into the existing UI without additional dependencies.

### Considerations & Challenges
1. The current implementation uses simple boolean loading states in some components but lacks consistency across the application
2. There's no visual feedback for users during data fetching operations in several components
3. Some components like `ChannelsPanel` and `MembersPanel` don't have any loading states
4. Need to implement skeleton loaders for a better user experience during data fetching
5. Should maintain consistency in loading state management across all components

## üìù Implementation Plan

### Prerequisites
No additional dependencies are needed as the required components (Skeleton and LoadingSpinner) already exist in the codebase.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Enhance Main Application Loading States**
   - Files to modify: `src/app/page.tsx`
   - Changes needed:
     - Add separate loading states for users and channels fetching
     - Replace simple "Loading..." text with skeleton loaders
     - Implement proper error handling for API requests

2. **Add Loading States to Channels Panel**
   - Files to modify: `src/components/slack/channels-panel.tsx`
   - Changes needed:
     - Add loading prop to component interface
     - Implement skeleton loaders for channel items when loading
     - Add visual feedback during search/filter operations

3. **Add Loading States to Members Panel**
   - Files to modify: `src/components/slack/members-panel.tsx`
   - Changes needed:
     - Add loading prop to component interface
     - Implement skeleton loaders for member items when loading
     - Add visual feedback during search/filter operations

4. **Enhance Message List Loading States**
   - Files to modify: `src/components/slack/message-list.tsx`, `src/components/slack/chat-container.tsx`
   - Changes needed:
     - Add loading state to `MessageList` component
     - Implement skeleton loaders for messages
     - Update `ChatContainer` to pass loading state to `MessageList`

5. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Files to modify: Components with fetch operations
   - Changes needed:
     - Add consistent error handling for all API requests
     - Display user-friendly error messages
     - Implement retry mechanisms where appropriate

### Testing Strategy
1. Manual testing of all components that fetch data:
   - Verify loading states display correctly
   - Confirm skeleton loaders appear during data fetching
   - Check error handling for failed API requests
   - Test all user interactions during loading states

2. Browser DevTools testing:
   - Simulate slow network conditions
   - Test with offline mode to verify error handling
   - Check console for any errors or warnings

3. Cross-component testing:
   - Verify consistency in loading state implementation
   - Ensure skeleton loaders match the design of actual components
   - Test responsive behavior of loading states

## üéØ Success Criteria
1. All components that fetch data display visual feedback during loading
2. Skeleton loaders are implemented for lists and data-heavy components
3. Loading states are consistent across the application
4. Error handling is improved for all API requests
5. User experience is enhanced with clear visual feedback during data operations
6. No regressions in existing functionality
