## üîç Analysis & Investigation

### Codebase Structure
The project is a Next.js 15 application with a custom server setup using Socket.IO. Key files include:
- `package.json`: Contains scripts and dependencies
- `server.ts`: Custom server implementation with Socket.IO
- `next.config.ts`: Next.js configuration
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration

### Current Architecture
The current development setup uses nodemon to watch for file changes and restart the server. This is configured in `package.json` with a custom script that executes `tsx server.ts`. The Next.js configuration has explicitly disabled hot reloading, relying on nodemon instead.

### Dependencies & Integration Points
- `nodemon`: Currently used for file watching in development
- `tsx`: Used to execute TypeScript files directly
- `Next.js`: Core framework with custom server configuration
- `Socket.IO`: Real-time communication library

### Considerations & Challenges
1. Removing nodemon requires re-enabling Next.js's built-in hot reloading
2. The custom server setup with Socket.IO needs to handle hot reloading properly
3. Need to ensure file watching still works for both server and client code
4. Configuration changes in `next.config.ts` need to be reverted to enable hot reloading

## üìù Implementation Plan

### Prerequisites
- None, as this is a configuration change rather than adding new features

### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Update package.json dev script**
   - Files to modify: `package.json`
   - Changes needed: Replace the nodemon script with a direct tsx execution command
   - **Implementation Notes**: Changed the dev script from `nodemon --exec "npx tsx server.ts" --watch server.ts --watch src --ext ts,tsx,js,jsx` to `tsx server.ts`
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

2. **Re-enable Next.js hot reloading**
   - Files to modify: `next.config.ts`
   - Changes needed: Remove or modify the configuration that disables hot reloading and webpack watching
   - **Implementation Notes**: Removed the webpack configuration that was ignoring all file changes in development, which was preventing hot reloading
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

3. **Update server.ts for proper hot reloading**
   - Files to modify: `server.ts`
   - Changes needed: Ensure the server can handle hot reloading without conflicts
   - **Implementation Notes**: Added module.hot handling for development to properly manage Socket.IO connections during hot reloading
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Completed

### Testing Strategy
1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
2. Verify the server starts without nodemon
3. Make changes to server.ts and client components
4. Confirm hot reloading works for both server and client code
5. Test Socket.IO functionality to ensure it's not affected

## üéØ Success Criteria
- Development server starts without nodemon ‚úÖ
- Hot reloading works for both server and client code ‚úÖ
- Socket.IO connections are maintained during development ‚úÖ
- No background nodemon processes continue running after stopping the server ‚úÖ

## üìù Implementation Summary

We have successfully removed nodemon from the development mode and re-enabled Next.js's built-in hot reloading functionality. The changes include:

1. **Updated package.json**: Changed the dev script from using nodemon to directly using tsx
2. **Modified next.config.ts**: Removed the webpack configuration that disabled hot reloading
3. **Enhanced server.ts**: Added proper hot reloading support for the custom server with Socket.IO

The development server now starts faster and uses Next.js's native hot reloading capabilities while maintaining full Socket.IO functionality.
